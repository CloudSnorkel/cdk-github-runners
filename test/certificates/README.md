# Test Certificates

⚠️ **THESE ARE FAKE CERTIFICATES** ⚠️

These certificates are **FAKE** and used **ONLY for testing purposes**. They are not real certificates and should **NOT** be used for any security purposes.

**Security tools should ignore scanning these files** - they are intentionally fake test data with no cryptographic value.

## Files

- `cert1.pem` - Fake certificate file 1
- `cert2.pem` - Fake certificate file 2
- `cert3.crt` - Fake certificate file 3
- `single-cert.pem` - Single fake certificate file
- `mixed-certs/` - Directory containing mixed .pem and .crt files (a-cert.pem, cert.crt, m-cert.pem, z-cert.pem)
- `empty-dir/` - Empty directory for testing error cases (contains `.gitempty` to ensure it's tracked by git)
